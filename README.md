# PythonProgramming

Rep of Python coding during my master's program for an assignment to examine the homophily and social contagion of cheating in a large-scale massive multiplayer online game. The task is to identify whether cheaters tend to team up with other cheaters more than by chance, and whether observing cheating makes it more likely for one to become a cheater. The code also builds an alternative universe to simulate cheating under random allocations of co-players.
